<h2>We know tea. We drink tea. We sell tea.</h2>
<p>Our tea is available for sale by weight starting at 50g up to 500g. At 250g we offer 10% savings and at 500g we offer 25% savings. We also offer an 'intro' size tin that makes about 10 cups of tea and a sample tin that makes 1-2 cups of tea. All of our tea can be re-infused with water a 2nd time in one sitting, which doubles the value of your loose tea. Some types of tea, such as oolong re-infuse 4-5 times, so be sure to get the most of your tea.</p>
<p>We offer a refill discount when you bring any tin or bag to be refilled, so if you still have any of our old tins we can still refill them. We are also happy to refill any non-tea girl tin to help reduce waste.</p>
<p>We also have a loyal-tea card program which that you can get a stamp for every $5 spent on loose tea. You receive a 15% discount on your tea order with a full card of 20 stamps.</p>
