      We have a kitchen on site where we bake almost all of our own desserts. We have a daily soup selection and chili

    <h2>Recent Expansion!</h2>
    <p>
      Recently The Tea Girl expanded by taking over the space next door. We added in a kitchen to bake our
      food on site and now have double the window space, which brightens our space with full natural light.
      We added seating but still kept our cozy decor and atmosphere.
    </p>
    <h2>Meetings, Groups and Special Events</h2>
    <p>
      We welcome everyone at the tea house, and we feel it is a great place to meet with a group. If you plan to come
      with a group of more than 10, calling ahead can help us accommodate you. We do have some larger tables that
      are well suited for fitting more people around them.  We do not offer space for private functions, or host open
      mics or private music groups. Our atmosphere is geared towards connection and conversation, and we would like
      to allow our customers that opportunity any time they visit. We do however participate in many 124th Street
      sponsored events like Make Music Edmonton, The Red Shoe Crawl, and All is Bright if you want to catch a special
      event at the store.
